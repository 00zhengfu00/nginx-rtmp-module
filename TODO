- Input buffers:
  allocate a continuous block &
  allocate input buffers
  in it. Upon chunk size change 
  re-split the same buffer for
  new chunk size. Use temp
  buffer as temporary
  storage of overflow data.
  Max chunk size if 65K which is
  really a lot.

- Output buffers:
  implement shared (per-loc/srv) buffers 
  for output of a) header(max 18b) b) chunk (fixed-sized)
  We never change output chunk size.
  Chunk buffers should be ref-counted.

- implement loc confs (=fms apps)
    loc options:
    - session buckets
    - broadcast/file
    - input buffer size per connection
    - output chunk size
    - output chunk buffer size
    - output header buffer size
    - HTTP callbacks on invoke calls
