==nginx-rtmp-module==

NGINX-based RTMP server

* Live streaming of video/audio

* Advanced buffering techniques
  to keep memory allocations at a minimum
  level for faster streaming and low
  memory footprint

* Works with Flash RTMP clients as well as
  ffmpeg/rtmpdump/flvstreamer etc
  (see examples in test/ subdir)


Example nginx.conf:


rtmp {

    server {

        listen 1935;

        wait_key_frame on;

        chunk_size 128;

        max_buf 1000000;

    }
}
