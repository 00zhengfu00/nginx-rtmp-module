== nginx-rtmp-module ==

NGINX-based RTMP server

* Live streaming of video/audio

* Recording published streams in FLV file

* H264 support

* HTTP callbacks on publish/play/record

* Advanced buffering techniques
  to keep memory allocations at a minimum
  level for faster streaming and low
  memory footprint

* Works with Flash RTMP clients as well as
  ffmpeg/rtmpdump/flvstreamer etc
  (see examples in test/ subdir)

* Statistics in XML/XSL in machine- & human-
  readable form


Build:

cd to NGINX source directory & run this:

./configure --add-module=<path-to-nginx-rtmp-module>
make
make install


Note the module does not share data between workers
and only works in one-worker mode. 


RTMP URL format:

rtmp://rtmp.example.com/<app>[/<name>]

<app> -  should match one of application {}
         blocks in config
<name> - interpreted by each application
         can be empty


Example nginx.conf:

rtmp {

    server {

        listen 1935;

        chunk_size 4000;

        max_buf 1M;

        # TV mode: one publisher, many subscribers
        application mytv {

            # enable live streaming
            live on;

            # record first 1K of stream
            record all;
            record_path /tmp/av;
            record_max_size 1K;

            # publish only from localhost
            allow publish 127.0.0.1;
            deny publish all;

            #allow play all;
        }

        # Many publishers, many subscribers
        # no checks, no recording
        application videochat {

            live on;

            # The following notifications receive all 
            # the session variables as well as 
            # particular call arguments in HTTP POST
            # request

            # Make HTTP request & use HTTP retcode
            # to decide whether to allow publishing
            # from this connection or not
            on_publish http://localhost:8080/publish;

            # Same with playing
            on_play http://localhost:8080/play;

            # record 10 video keyframes (no audio) every 2 minutes
            record keyframes;
            record_path /tmp/vc;
            record_max_frames 10;
            record_interval 2m;

            # Async notify about an flv recorded
            on_record_done http://localhost:8080/record_done;

        }

    }
}

# HTTP can be used for accessing RTMP stats
http {

    server {

        listen      8080;

        # This URL provides RTMP statistics in XML
        location /stat {
            rtmp_stat all;

            # Use this stylesheet to view XML as web page
            # in browser
            rtmp_stat_stylesheet stat.xsl;
        }

        location /stat.xsl {
            # XML stylesheet to view RTMP stats.
            # Copy stat.xsl wherever you want
            # and put the full directory path here
            root /path/to/stat.xsl/;
        }

    }
